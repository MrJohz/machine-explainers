        Encryption is surprisingly easy. All you need are some random numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's say you and your friend have a book full of thousands and
        thousands of random numbers, and you want to send them a message that
        only they can read.
      </p>
      <p>
        All you need to do is take each letter of your message, and each random
        number, and add them together (or at least, move each letter through the
        alphabet based on the random number.)
