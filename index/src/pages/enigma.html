        <p>It was 1914, and the Dutch had a problem.</p>
        <p>
          A new pan-European war had just broken out, a war that would become
          known as the Great War for its global scale and the incalculable
          impact on the lives of its participants. The Netherlands, with a
          reasonable amount of foresight, decided to opt out, and declared
          themselves neutral.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, neutrality in war is not a magic charm, and the
          Netherlands quickly found themselves spending a lot of effort
          defending their claim. Leaving aside the various accidental attacks —
          much of the Northern European countryside looks the same to a bomber
          flying 3 kilometres up in the air — the Netherlands also had to defend
          against more deliberate intrusions into their sovereign waters.
        </p>
        <p>
          These problems weren't just limited to the homeland either — far away,
          in the Dutch East Indies (now known as Indonesia), the Dutch claim of
          neutrality was also being tested. A Dutch squadron patrolled the
          archipelago, but to avoid international incidents that could threaten
          the Netherlands' unaligned status, ships had to radio in to colonial
          headquarters before each engagement.
        </p>
        <p>
          To preserve secrecy and speed up communications on what was
          essentially an open channel, ships had been issued with codebooks —
          books filled with pages and pages of pre-arranged phrases and words,
          each assigned a different (ideally secret) code. Unfortunately, this
          was less than ideal: in peacetime, the secret codes were often far
          less closely guarded, forcing the Dutch Navy to publish a "secret
          appendix" of even more secret codes. Moreover, these books were rarely
          designed to deal with the complexities faced by the squadron in
          colonies, leaving them floundering and struggling to communicate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Into this situation stepped Theo van Hengel and R.P.C. Spengler, two
          Dutch naval officers with a passion for designing torpedoes. In early
          1915, the two men started work on an entirely new innovation in
          cryptography: the rotary cypher.

        <p>
          Here's the problem with cyphers in a nutshell: human writing is very
          predictable. In a block of English text, for example, the letter "e"
          is most common, followed by "t" and "a". Letters like "a" and "o" are
          more common at the start of words, but "s" and "d" often end up at the
          end. The challenge of encipherment is to create a cypher where,
          however predictable the input is, the output appears to be completely
          random.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consider the demo below. It's a very simple cypher where we take all
          the letters of a text and rotate them through the alphabet by a fixed
          amount (the key). They key will be a letter from <code>A</code> to
          <code>Z</code> — if the key is <code>A</code>, we'll move each
          character along by one letter, if it's <code>B</code>, two, and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Below each text input is a histogram showing the letter frequencies in
          the input and output. You can change the input text and the key, and
          watch how this changes both the output text, and the two histograms.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="caeser-demo" class="demo"></div>
      <div class="section">
        <p>
          As you can see, the output is just as predictable as the input. If the
          input follows the normal rules of English ("e" as the most common
          letter, "s" at the ends of words, etc.), then the output will follow
          the same rules, just shifted along in the alphabet a bit.
        </p>
        <p>
          One solution to this is to use more keys (or rather, have a key made
          of multiple letters). For example, with three-letter key, we can split
          the plaintext into chunks of three letters. Each letter in that chunk
          gets encrypted with a different letter of the key.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the demo below, you can see this at work. With keys of different
          lengths, you can see how the distribution changes. With very short
          keys (one or two letters), the patterns are still mostly recognisable,
          but with a five- or six-letter key, the pattern is harder to
          recognise.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="long-key-demo" class="demo"></div>
      <div class="section">
        <p>
          That said, harder to recognise does not mean impossible! For an
          example of this, consider the key <code>ENI</code>. The
          <code>I</code> means that every third letter in the plaintext has been
          rotated nine places — "a"s are now "j"s, "b"s are now "k"s, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          We know that "e" is the most common letter, and "e" +
          <code>I</code> is "n". If you look at the cyphertext histogram, you'll
          see that "n" is probably taller than both of its neighbours. Although
          using a longer key has helped scramble the letters, there are still
          some recognisable patterns. If you play around with this demo a bit
          more, you might spot some other patterns that show up regularly.

        <p>
          Spengler and Van Hengel had two key innovations over the simpler
          cyphers from before. The first was simple, and not entirely new.
          Rather than use a single, repeating key, they would instead generate
          the key as the message was being encoded. If you could design that
          process in such a way, that each new letter of the key looked quite
          random to the outside observer, but could in fact be determined
          consistently by both the sender and the receiver, then the message
          would be almost completely uncrackable.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, generating such a complicated key by hand would be a slow
          process, and, given the tense political situation in the Dutch East
          Indies, speed was very much of the essence. This was the second — and
          significantly more important — innovation: to provide a machine that
          would do the generation for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          The core idea of the machine they came up with is simple: consider a
          wheel split up into 24 segments. Give each segment an input letter,
          <code>A</code> to <code>Z</code>, and wire everything up so that when
          I type "a", it goes to the <code>A</code> segment of the wheel.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inside the wheel, you then wire the input of each segment to the
          output of a different segment. For example, the <code>A</code> segment
          might carry the signal to the <code>S</code> segment. Now when I type
          "a", it goes into the <code>A</code> segment, and out of the
          <code>S</code> segment, giving me the result "s".
        </p>
        <p>
          Here's the trick: now, every time I type a letter, first rotate the
          wheel by one place. Now, when I type "a", it'll instead go to the "b"
          segment. And if I type "a" again, the signal will go to the "c"
          segment, and so on. But because each of the input segments has a
          different output, the outputs will also be jumbled up.
