          Here's the problem in a nutshell: human writing is really predictable.
        </p>
        <p>
          The simplest possible cypher takes your text and rotates all the
          letters through the alphabet by a fixed amount. We can call this
          amount the key, and for the sake of convenience, our key will always
          be a letter from <code>A</code>–<code>Z</code>. So if our key is
          <code>C</code>, we'll rotate each letter from our input text by three
          characters (because C is the third letter of the alphabet).
        </p>
        <p>
          But this doesn't really change the input text all that much — sure,
          all the letters are now different, but because we know what human
          writing <em>ought</em> to look like, we can make some reasonable
          guesses as to what the cypher text actually is.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here's a demonstration. On the left is some text, and a key. On the
          right is the output after we've passed the text through our very
          simple cypher. Below that, are two charts — one shows the distribution
          of letters in our original text, and the other shows how they're
          distributed after being encrypted.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can change the text and the key and see how the results change.
